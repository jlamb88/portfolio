                <p>My name is Joseph Lamb and I have had a diverse career path thus far. After graduating from Georgia Tech with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Applied Psychology with a specialization in human factors, user interfaces, and man-machine systems, I worked for over 10 years as a business analyst and database analyst, gaining valuable technical skills and experience in data analysis, user testing and data reporting.</p>
                <p>However, I realized that I wanted to make a more direct impact on people's lives, which led me to return to graduate school and become a physician assistant. For 15 years, I had the privilege of specializing in spinal and neurosurgery and helping my patients and recover from various conditions and procedures.</p>

                <p>Despite my fulfilling career as a physician assistant, I maintained a keen interest in technology and decided to return to the technical world and pursued certification as a full stack web developer at Georgia Tech and gained skills in both front-end and back-end web development and design. I am excited to apply my skills to develop innovative solutions to help you and your business with your needs.</p>
